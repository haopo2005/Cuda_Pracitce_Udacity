=======dependency==========
ubuntu 16.04
CUDA 8.0
Opencv3.1.0

=================how to run=============
cmake .
make
./HW3 <your color image>


The program will enhance your color image with histogram equalization algortihm and then show the difference image between the cpu mode and gpu mode.
You may learn the skills about mapping of threads and compiling configurations.

However,
the problem set 3 download from github is inconsistent with the udacity test online. The cpu-mode codes and test sample images are totally different. 
Anyway, I have passed the exam of lesson 3.
